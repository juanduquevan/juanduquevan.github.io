    <h3><strong>Juan Duque</strong></h3>
    <p>I am a MSE candidate in the Computer Science department at Princeton University, under the         supervision of professors <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a>     and <a href="https://www.ehazan.com/">Elad Hazan</a>. My interests lie in the intersection of         Reinforcement Learning and Control Theory, with the goal of developing agents that can use             prior knowledge in unseen environments and adapt quickly through interaction and human                 feedback. </p>
