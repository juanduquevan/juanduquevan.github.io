    <h2>Juan Duque</h2>
    <p>I am a MSE candidate in the Computer Science department at Princeton University, under the           supervision of professors <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a>       and <a href="https://www.ehazan.com/">Elad Hazan</a>. My interests lie in the intersection of           Reinforcement Learning and Control Theory, with the goal of developing agents that can use               prior knowledge in unseen environments and adapt quickly to them through interaction and human           feedback.

    Prior to Princeton, I did my undergraduate at Georgia Tech where I worked with professors <a             href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Charles.Isbell/">Charles Isbell</a> and <a                           href="https://people.math.gatech.edu/~loss/">Michael Loss</a>.
